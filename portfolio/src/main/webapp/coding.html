       <h2>How I got into Coding</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">My coding background is fairly new. In the twelfth grade when it was time to apply for university programs, I was super unsure of what I wanted to pursue. I really loved science in high school and was never really exposed 
        to technology or coding. It was my sister who convinced me to go into computer science. I knew the industry was developing and there would be many opportunities for me. So I decided to go to Queen's University, in hopes of pursing a specialization 
        in biomedical computing. This way, I could learn about the science side implemented into technology. Luckily after my first coding course in first year of university, I ended up loving it. Technology is so powerful and there are endless possibilities
         to what it can be used for. Now, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can about how technology can help change the lives of others. </p>

    <h2>Projects I've Worked On</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li><b>SynHub:</b> A mobile application developed using Ionic Framework, which is based on AngularJS. The application acted as an IoT edge device, displaying the data collected from sensors around the company building.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Spoiler No Spoiling:</b> a google chrome extension that acts like a movie spoiler blocker. Type in a movie and the extension will blur out any paragraphs containing potential spoilers by using data extracted from the movie's IMDB page.</li>
