      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">I am a computer science student at Queen's University going into third year! My degree plans are to pursue a Major in Computing with a concentration in biomedical computation.</p>
      <img src="/images/me.jpg" width="375" height="560" class="center">
    <p style="text-align:justify">I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario with my sister and parents. I love spending time with my friends, whether it's going to music festivals, restaurants, playing wii games or even just picnics in the park.
        I really enjoy staying active. In high school, I played soccer and basketball competitively as well as volleyball with my school team. As much as I love jam-packing my days, I also enjoy staying in
        and catching up with what I'm currently watching on Netflix. </p>

        <h2>Life at University</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">When I'm not learning about data structures and algorithms in class, I love getting involved with the community at Queen's University. I am a part of several clubs and activities on campus:
            <ul>
                <li>Vice Chair of Events and Logistics on Queen's Women in Computing</li>
                <li>UX/UI Designer on Queen's Technology and Media Association</li>
                <li>Intramural Sports: Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, Basketball</li>
                <li>Logistics Executive of the Queen's Computing Orientation Committee</li>
            </ul>
                <img src="/images/oweek.jpg" width="350" height="250" class="center">
        <p style="text-align:justify">I loved orientation as a first year student so I decided to become an orientation leader and then now a part of the orientation commitee. I have been working with a team of 9 to plan Queen's University's 2020 Computing Orientation Week. We are currently working on the trainsition to a virtual orientation.</p>

    <h2>Projects I've Worked On</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li><b>SynHub:</b> A mobile application developed using Ionic Framework, which is based on AngularJS. The application acted as an IoT edge device, displaying the data collected from sensors around the company building.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Spoiler No Spoiling:</b> a google chrome extension that acts like a movie spoiler blocker. Type in a movie and the extension will blur out any paragraphs containing potential spoilers by using data extracted from the movie's IMDB page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I got into Coding</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">My coding background is fairly new. In the twelfth grade when it was time to apply for university programs, I was super unsure of what I wanted to pursue. I really loved science in high school and was never really exposed 
        to technology or coding. It was my sister who convinced me to go into computer science. I knew the industry was developing and there would be many opportunities for me. So I decided to go to Queen's University, in hopes of pursing a specialization 
        in biomedical computing. This way, I could learn about the science side implemented into technology. Luckily after my first coding course in first year of university, I ended up loving it. Technology is so powerful and there are endless possibilities
         to what it can be used for. Now, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can about how technology can help change the lives of others. </p>
