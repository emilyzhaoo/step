      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">I am a computer science student at Queen's University going into third year! My degree plans are to pursue a Major in Computing with a concentration in biomedical computation.</p>
      <img id="main-pic" src="/images/me.jpg" class="center">
      <p style="text-align:justify">I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario with my sister and parents. I love spending time with my friends, whether it's going to music festivals, restaurants, playing wii games or even just picnics in the park.
        I really enjoy staying active. In high school, I played soccer and basketball competitively as well as volleyball with my school team. As much as I love jam-packing my days, I also enjoy staying in
        and catching up with what I'm currently watching on Netflix. </p>

        <h2>Life at University</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">When I'm not learning about data structures and algorithms in class, I love getting involved with the community at Queen's University. I am a part of several clubs and activities on campus:
            <ul>
                <li>Vice Chair of Events and Logistics on Queen's Women in Computing</li>
                <li>UX/UI Designer on Queen's Technology and Media Association</li>
                <li>Intramural Sports: Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, Basketball</li>
                <li>Logistics Executive of the Queen's Computing Orientation Committee</li>
            </ul>
                <img src="/images/oweek.jpg" width="350" height="250" class="center">
        <p style="text-align:justify">I loved orientation as a first year student so I decided to become an orientation leader and then now a part of the orientation commitee. I have been working with a team of 9 to plan Queen's University's 2020 Computing Orientation Week. We are currently working on the trainsition to a virtual orientation.</p>
